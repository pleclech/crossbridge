                    The com.adobe.flascc.kernel package contains the interfaces and implementations of a subset of the BSD system calls that Crossbridge's libc calls. Although a reasonable default implementation is provided and compiled into every Crossbridge compiled SWF by default, you can overridde or extend it, as necessary, to provide custom functionality.

                    Flascc injects a preloader into every SWF unless told not to. This package includes the default implementation of that preloader. The source for the preloader is included in the Crossbridge SDK so that you can create your own.

                    Low-level C file system access is implemented in Crossbridge with a virtual file system API that lets you attach various backing stores so that files can be loaded and saved using different mechanisms. Depending on the backing store used, you can embed files in a SWF, load them from a URL, or load them  from a Local Shared Object.
