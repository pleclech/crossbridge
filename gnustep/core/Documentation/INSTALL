This package contains the core GNUstep libraries. You may need to
install other packages in order to use GNUstep. Read the file
GNUstep-HOWTO for instructions on how to install a complete GNUstep
system.  Other documentation is available on-line at http://www.gnustep.org

Installing gnustep

You can no longer install all the libraries at once, but you can use the
compile-all script to do essentially the same thing. We recommend,
however, that you compile and install each package individually. For
each package (make, base, gui, back), here is a quick-and-dirty example
of installation commands:

./configure
make
make install

GNUstep-HOWTO has better instructions (in the make subdirectory)
