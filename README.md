# [Crossbridge](www.crossbridge.io) (future branch)

### Goals 
At present we have quite straight goal:

* LLVM-Clang-3.2 toolchain 
* Freebsd 9.1 Environment
* Libc++ with support of c++11 std.

### Status
By checking against samples, 10 out of 17 pass.
The failure cases fall into 5 categories:

* Exception handling.
* Several system APIs required by pthread and other libs are not implemented.
* Swig-gen'ed code fails at compiling.
* Object-C lib not suport (Does anyone use it?) 
* Debug doesn't work well.

Since github has a file size limit, [A precompiled SDK] with the version hash code in name is put [HERE](http://sourceforge.net/projects/crossbridge/files/) in sourceforge. 
Please note that it could be removed in future.  
Any issue/suggestion/feedback/... please go to issue list.


### Get started in using Crossbridge
Clang is designed to be a drop-in of gcc. And the one in this SDK also keeps the same.  
If you are familiar with Crossbridge SDK 1.0, just get and use.  
If not, please take a look at the document README.html at first to get a basic idea.


### Get involved in development
--Build system  
The build system only supports Mac OS officially.  
(Well, building in Cygwin is possible, but please pay more patience.)  
So assume you have a machine like what I have 

* Mac OS 10.7+
* Xcode 4.6+ 
* Memory 4G (8G+ would be great)
* Macport/Homebrew


--Tools and libs required for building  
Use macport/homebrew to install autoconf, automake, ccache, cmake, gettext,  
 glib, gmp, libmpc, mpfr, pkg-config, readline

For homebrew users, unzip [libmpc.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/projects/crossbridge/files/) to /opt/local/lib

--Start Building it  
Once you've downloaded the code base, say:  
> $ git clone https://github.com/adobe-flash/crossbridge.git -b futures  
> $ cd crossbridge && make

Build log will be placed in ./build/mac/log. 
SDK will be placed in ./sdk.  



--Get in developing  
Since the learning curve is not low, what I had were  
1 Read README.html and try examples to learn basic usage.  
2 Setup env and try to build it.
3 Get an overall idea on the process of compiler.  
4 Get a big picture on how Crossbridge compiler works, especially on generating AS/ABC.  
5 Walk through specific code path and verify your idea via debugging.  

--Extra learning materials  
These parts will be put alone with code base.


### License
The code written by adobe is all MIT licensed, but crossbridge contains many different open source projects which have different licenses, check the source files before making any assumptions.
